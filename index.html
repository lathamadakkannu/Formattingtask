					<h3>Roses are multi-petal flowers available in an array of colours. Some varieties are known for their prickles along the stems of the plant, which are used to deter predators. Many species are now cultivated although there are still varieties that grow in the wild.
						Roses are native to China but are now grown across the world and thrive in sunny, well-drained soil. They particularly like clay soils and it is best to grow roses away from other plants so their roots are not disturbed. It is important to remember that hybridized flowers such as roses have become more adaptable to different conditions so check when buying your roses what the optimum conditions are.
